We explore neural network-based optimization of diffractive optical elements (DOEs) in the THz range, leveraging automatic differentiation to accommodate the discrete material layers of 3D printers during phase profile synthesis. Our method enhances DOE design efficiency and flexibility, addressing fabrication constraints while optimizing radiation control.
